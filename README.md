Blogging has become such a mania that new blog is being created every second of
every minute. A blog is your best bet for a voice among the online crowd. Blogs
were usually the work of a single individual occasionally of a small group, and
often covered a single subject. More recently, multi-author blogs (MABs) have
developed, with posts written by large numbers of authors and professionally
edited.

In this project we have included the facility of multi-author blogs, which will allow
the bloggers to interact even with the more people of the same interest.

One of the key feature of the website designed is that a visitor is able to add a
comment to any post made by the blogger (i.e. doesnâ€™t need to be a blogger).

There is a separate admin interface for the superuser of the website to directly do
the all the change that can be done by the blogger plus some additional
functionality.

Link to other websites such LinkedIn and GitHub, etc. are also available in the
navbar of the website.

Contact page and about section link has also be provided in the navbar for
communication purpose and other details.
